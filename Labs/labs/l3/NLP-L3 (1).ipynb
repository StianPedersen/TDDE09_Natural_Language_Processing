inspect the attention patterns for selected German sentences. Try to find sentences for which the model produces reasonably good English translations. If your German is a bit rusty (or non-existent), use sentences from the validation data. It might be interesting to look at examples where the German and the English word order differ substantially. Document your exploration in a short reflection piece (ca. 150 words). Respond to the following prompts:\n","\n","* What sentences did you try out? What patterns did you spot? Include example heatmaps in your notebook.\n","\"es war einmal ein junge\" \"there once was a boy\" : Translated to \"It was once a boy\". Maybe \"it\" should have been \"there\" but otherwise, the main idea of there once being a boy was captured by the model. This can also be noted by watching the model attending to the word \"einmal\" or \"once.\n","\n","* Based on what you know about attention, did you expect your results? Was there anything surprising in them?\n","We believe we got the expected results. I.e., the sentence \"ich habe ein traum .\" the word \"dream\" was central. This is because that particullar word is in fact central for the sentence. Without the word dream the sentence becomes arbitrary and can instead be the sentence \"ich bin ein fußball\". We also see that the common words \"ich\" are not given much attention.\n","\n","* What did you learn? How, exactly, did you learn it? Why does this learning matter?\n","We learned how to build models that take all the previous outputs into account, not only the last part (unrolling). This is bone by stepping through the model. We now know how to fix wrong tensor-sizes, and to match different tensors before performing calculations on them.
