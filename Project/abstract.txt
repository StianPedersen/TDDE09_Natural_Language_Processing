Project abstract
In this project we have extended the arc-standard and static-oracle dependency parser created in Lab 4 and Lab5 with an arc-hybrid 
and dynamic-oracle dependency parser. The baseline is trained using arc-standard and static-oracle. The baseline dependency parser is compared
to three other dependency parsers created in this project: arc-standard with dynamic-oracle, arc-hybrid with static-oracle and arc-hybrid with
dynamic oracle. Furthermore, these dependency parsers are both trained using part-of-speech tagged sentences from the tagger created in Lab 4, 
and golden part-of-speech tagged sentences given by the Universal Dependencies treebanks. We use the English and Nynorsk treebanks to evaluate
the dependency treebanks, both of which are projectivized. The results show that for all testcases the golden part-of-speech tags outperform our 
tagger which is expected. For the English treebank we see a decrease of 2.5% accuracy when using the arc-hybrid with dynamic-oracle over using the 
arc-hybrid with a static oracle, the latter giving accuracy of 73%. An interesting finding is that using the arc-hybrid with a static-oracle outperforms 
all the other parsers, where using the dynamic oracle *results not done*.
