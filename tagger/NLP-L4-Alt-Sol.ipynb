Such a triple specifies that the model should include $m$ instances of an embedding from $n$ items to vectors of size $e$. All of the $m$ instances are to share their weights. In this lab, the embeddings will be embeddings for words and tags. For example, to instantiate the default feature model, you would initialise the model with the following specifications:\n",
