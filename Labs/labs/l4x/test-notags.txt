I	_
sympathise	_
with	_
the	_
Article	_

are	_
certainly	_

nasty	_

the	_

wiped	_

he	_
could	_
n't	_
even	_
begin	_
to	_
try	_
without	_
nuclear	_

he	_
has	_
insisted	_
that	_

Many	_
people	_
want	_
to	_

But	_
will	_
diplomacy	_
work	_

And	_
can	_
anyone	_
use	_
military	_
pressure	_
without	_
proof	_
?	_

One	_
reader	_
pointed	_
out	_
that	_
the	_
President	_
watched	_
the	_
Americans	_
in	_
the	_
embassy	_
when	_
they	_
took	_
them	_
hostage	_

has	_
denied	_
this	_

him	_

we	_
ca	_

,	_
but	_
out	_
of	_
the	_
NY	_
Times	_
and	_
Washington	_
Post	_
completely	_
.	_

I	_
had	_
to	_
go	_
to	_
the	_
BBC	_
for	_
this	_
report	_
.	_

It	_
's	_
symptomatic	_
,	_
I	_
suppose	_
,	_
of	_
our	_
fast	_
-	_
paced	_
,	_
24	_
hour	_
news	_
-	_
cycle	_
lives	_
,	_
that	_
the	_
biggest	_
short	_
-	_
term	_
humanitarian	_
crisis	_
in	_
the	_
world	_
would	_
quickly	_
be	_
eclipsed	_
,	_
once	_
our	_
Secretary	_
of	_
State	_
was	_
finished	_
with	_
his	_
whirlwind	_
tour	_
,	_
from	_
the	_
newspapers	_
.	_

It	_
's	_
just	_
disappointing	_
.	_

Most	_
troubling	_
,	_
however	_
,	_
is	_
the	_
fact	_
that	_
the	_
political	_
will	_
to	_
end	_
the	_
crisis	_
expressed	_
a	_
few	_
short	_
weeks	_
ago	_
seems	_
to	_
have	_
ebbed	_
.	_

At	_
that	_
time	_
,	_
UN	_
Secretary	_
General	_
Kofi	_
Annan	_
demanded	_
steps	_
be	_
taken	_
to	_
end	_
the	_
ethnic	_
violence	_
in	_
Darfur	_
within	_
48	_
hours	_
.	_

Two	_
weeks	_
later	_
,	_
and	_
the	_
violence	_
continues	_
.	_

The	_
African	_
Union	_
is	_
clearly	_
not	_
up	_
to	_
the	_
task	_
of	_
keeping	_
the	_
peace	_
,	_
pledging	_
300	_
troops	_
to	_
an	_
area	_
that	_
will	_
need	_
15,000	_
,	_
according	_
to	_
analysts	_
.	_

And	_
international	_
donors	_
have	_
given	_
only	_
half	_
of	_
the	_
relief	_
aid	_
that	_
Darfur	_
needs	_
,	_
according	_
to	_
the	_
local	_
UN	_
officials	_
.	_

So	_
hear	_
we	_
are	_
,	_
two	_
weeks	_
later	_
,	_
after	_
that	_
dazzling	_
PR	_
display	_
two	_
weeks	_
ago	_
by	_
Powell	_
and	_
Annan	_
,	_
and	_
the	_
situation	_
on	_
the	_
ground	_
in	_
Darfur	_
appears	_
basically	_
unchanged	_
.	_

Warren	_
Buffett	_
is	_
giving	_
away	_
85	_
%	_
of	_
his	_
wealth	_
,	_
mostly	_
to	_
the	_
Bill	_
and	_
Melinda	_
Gates	_
Foundation	_
.	_

It	_
's	_
a	_
move	_
that	_
really	_
worries	_
me	_
;	_
Buffett	_
's	_
usual	_
justification	_
for	_
keeping	_
most	_
of	_
his	_
money	_
was	_
that	_
he	_
was	_
still	_
compounding	_
the	_
value	_
of	_
his	_
fortune	_
at	_
a	_
pretty	_
high	_
rate	_
,	_
so	_
any	_
gifts	_
now	_
would	_
mean	_
significantly	_
less	_
money	_
for	_
the	_
foundation	_
later	_
.	_

It	_
's	_
a	_
little	_
hard	_
to	_
parse	_
,	_
but	_
at	_
this	_
point	_
his	_
ostensible	_
view	_
is	_
that	_
the	_
Gateses	_
are	_
very	_
good	_
money	_
-	_
redistributors	_
,	_
and	_
he	_
wants	_
them	_
to	_
have	_
the	_
money	_
as	_
soon	_
as	_
possible	_
.	_

Which	_
essentially	_
sounds	_
like	_
he	_
's	_
worried	_
that	_
Bill	_
or	_
Melinda	_
are	_
going	_
to	_
die	_
soon	_
.	_

I	_
assume	_
his	_
actual	_
reason	_
is	_
that	_
he	_
's	_
worried	_
that	_
Berkshire	_
Hathaway	_
just	_
ca	_
n't	_
grow	_
quickly	_
enough	_
to	_
justify	_
his	_
usual	_
charity	_
policy	_
.	_

I	_
'm	_
not	_
sure	_
how	_
the	_
market	_
will	_
react	_
.	_

It	_
does	_
n't	_
change	_
the	_
company	_
's	_
intrinsic	_
worth	_
,	_
and	_
as	_
the	_
article	_
notes	_
,	_
the	_
company	_
might	_

This	_
acceptance	_
of	_
blatantly	_
terrorist	_
groups	_
as	_
legitimate	_
freedom	_
movements	_
is	_
a	_
cancerous	_
tumor	_
on	_
the	_

and	_
the	_

Over	_
three	_
years	_
after	_
9-11	_
,	_
the	_
United	_
Nations	_
,	_
despite	_
their	_
attempts	_
to	_
project	_
strength	_
in	_
fighting	_
terrorism	_
,	_
still	_
can	_
not	_
properly	_
define	_
the	_
word	_
"	_
terrorist	_
"	_
,	_
waffling	_
over	_
the	_
issue	_
of	_
whether	_
the	_
murder	_
of	_
innocent	_
civilians	_
are	_
terrorist	_
acts	_
.	_

The	_
media	_
routinely	_
obscures	_
the	_
lines	_
between	_
terrorism	_
and	_
legitimate	_
resistance	_
,	_
as	_
the	_
recent	_
article	_
by	_
Daniel	_
Okrent	_
of	_
The	_
New	_
York	_
Times	_
demonstrates	_
.	_

...	_

The	_
decision	_
to	_
sidestep	_
the	_
obvious	_
to	_
satisfy	_
the	_
need	_
to	_
avoid	_
confrontation	_
does	_
not	_
bring	_
peace	_
,	_
but	_
only	_
delays	_
the	_
eventual	_
conflict	_
as	_
the	_
predators	_
of	_
Hamas	_
and	_
Hezbollah	_
exploit	_
the	_
inherent	_
weakness	_
of	_
the	_
internationals	_
and	_
the	_
media	_
.	_

I	_
've	_
been	_
fuming	_
over	_
this	_
fact	_
for	_
a	_
few	_
weeks	_
now	_
,	_
ever	_
since	_
some	_
organizations	_
and	_
governments	_
suggested	_
we	_
need	_
to	_
accept	_
the	_
fact	_
that	_
Hezbollah	_
will	_
get	_
involved	_
in	_
running	_
Lebanon	_
.	_

Wtf	_
is	_
this	_
?	_

This	_
is	_
a	_
terrorist	_
organization	_
plain	_
and	_
simple	_
.	_

This	_
is	_
the	_
organization	_
that	_
bombed	_
our	_
Marine	_
barracks	_
in	_
1983	_
,	_
took	_
Americans	_
hostage	_
throughout	_
the	_
80's	_
and	_
now	_
they	_
should	_
be	_
considered	_
a	_
legitimate	_
organization	_
?	_

This	_
is	_
just	_
another	_
reason	_
to	_
never	_
trust	_
the	_
MSM	_
,	_
and	_
certainly	_
not	_
the	_
Europeans	_
.	_

The	_
Iraqi	_
Islamic	_
Party	_
lead	_
by	_
Muhsin	_
Abdul	_
Hamid	_
,	_
has	_
been	_
among	_
the	_
few	_
Sunni	_
Muslim	_
groups	_
willing	_
to	_
cooperate	_
(	_
even	_
if	_
rather	_
lukewarmly	_
)	_
with	_
the	_
Americans	_
.	_

It	_
is	_
now	_
threatening	_
to	_
pull	_
out	_
of	_
the	_
Allawi	_
caretaker	_
government	_
.	_

The	_
IIP	_
had	_
also	_
been	_
the	_
main	_
force	_
urging	_
Sunni	_
Arabs	_
to	_
participate	_
in	_
the	_
elections	_
scheduled	_
for	_
January	_
,	_
and	_
had	_
been	_
opposed	_
in	_
this	_
stance	_
by	_
the	_
Association	_
of	_
Muslim	_
Scholars	_
.	_

That	_
the	_
Iraqi	_
Islamic	_
Party	_
is	_
now	_
contemplating	_
leaving	_
the	_
Allawi	_
government	_
raises	_
the	_
question	_
of	_
whether	_
a	_
mass	_
Sunni	_
Arab	_
boycott	_
of	_
the	_
elections	_
is	_
in	_
the	_
offing	_
,	_
thus	_
fatally	_
weakening	_
the	_
legitimacy	_
of	_
any	_
new	_
government	_
.	_

al	_
-	_
Qaeda	_
during	_
the	_
Afghan	_
resistance	_
days	_
.	_

One	_
witness	_
at	_
the	_
Moutasaddiq	_
trial	_
in	_
Germany	_
alleged	_
that	_
Zarqawi	_
had	_
not	_
allowed	_
Monotheism	_
and	_
Holy	_
War	_
to	_
share	_
resources	_
with	_
al	_
-	_
Qaeda	_
in	_
the	_
early	_
zeroes	_
of	_
the	_
21st	_
century	_
.	_

If	_
the	_
statement	_
is	_
true	_
,	_
it	_
is	_
a	_
worrying	_
sign	_
that	_
even	_
the	_
divided	_
small	_
radical	_
guerrilla	_
groups	_
are	_
being	_
"	_
picked	_
up	_
"	_
by	_
al	_
-	_
Qaeda	_
.	_

This	_
consolidation	_
is	_
obviously	_
a	_
result	_
of	_
Bush	_
's	_
aggressive	_
invasion	_
of	_
Iraq	_
and	_
of	_
the	_
botching	_
of	_
the	_
aftermath	_
.	_

It	_
is	_
a	_
setback	_
for	_
the	_
war	_
on	_
terror	_
.	_

Al	_
-	_
Qaeda	_
in	_
Afghanistan	_
was	_
a	_
group	_
of	_
only	_
a	_
few	_
hundred	_
"	_
Afghan	_
Arabs	_
"	_
who	_
pledged	_
personal	_
loyalty	_
to	_
Usamah	_
Bin	_
Laden	_
.	_

It	_
could	_
notionally	_
be	_
expanded	_
to	_
encompass	_
the	_
5,000	_
-	_
strong	_
"	_
55th	_
Brigade	_
"	_
of	_
the	_
Taliban	_
regime	_
,	_
though	_
this	_
is	_
not	_
the	_
technical	_
definition	_
.	_

Because	_
Usamah	_
is	_
Saudi	_
,	_
my	_
guess	_
is	_
that	_
they	_
were	_
especially	_
influenced	_
by	_
an	_
extremist	_
form	_
of	_
the	_
Wahhabi	_
school	_
of	_
Islam	_
that	_
predominates	_
among	_
Saudia	_
's	_
some	_
15	_
million	_
citizens	_
.	_

In	_
1998	_
they	_
were	_
joined	_
by	_
Egyptians	_
from	_
the	_
al	_
-	_
Jihad	_
al	_
-	_
Islami	_
group	_
of	_
Ayman	_
al	_
-	_
Zawahiri	_
(	_
many	_
of	_
these	_
were	_
from	_
Upper	_
Egypt	_
,	_
especially	_
Asyut	_
and	_
environs	_
)	_
.	_

After	_
that	_
point	_
,	_
al	_
-	_
Qaeda	_
was	_
a	_
joint	_
enterprise	_
between	_
the	_
Egyptian	_
extremists	_
and	_
the	_
polyglot	_
Arabs	_
around	_
Bin	_
Laden	_
,	_
only	_
some	_
of	_
whom	_
were	_
Saudi	_
.	_

Zarqawi	_
is	_
a	_
Jordanian	_
,	_
and	_
his	_
Monotheism	_
and	_
Holy	_
War	_
group	_
in	_
Afghanistan	_
probably	_
had	_
a	_
distinctive	_
coloration	_
as	_
mainly	_
Jordanian	_
,	_
Palestinian	_
and	_
Syrian	_
.	_

They	_
also	_
had	_
a	_
special	_
connection	_
to	_
some	_
extremists	_
in	_
Jordan	_
and	_
Germany	_
.	_

They	_
are	_
probably	_
especially	_
oriented	_
toward	_
the	_
Salafi	_
school	_
of	_
modern	_
Islamic	_
thought	_
,	_
which	_
has	_
a	_
Protestant	_
-	_
like	_
emphasis	_
on	_
going	_
back	_
to	_
the	_
original	_
practice	_
of	_
the	_
early	_
companions	_
of	_
the	_
Prophet	_
Muhammad	_
.	_

(	_
Most	_
Salafis	_
are	_
not	_
militant	_
or	_
violent	_
,	_
though	_
they	_
tend	_
to	_
be	_
rather	_
narrow	_
-	_
minded	_
in	_
my	_
experience	_
,	_
on	_
the	_
order	_
of	_
Protestant	_
Pietists	_
)	_
.	_

Monotheism	_
and	_
Holy	_
War	_
obviously	_
does	_
have	_
a	_
violent	_
interpretation	_
of	_
Salafism	_
,	_
rather	_
as	_
the	_
the	_
leaders	_
of	_
the	_
so	_
-	_
called	_
German	_
Peasant	_
Rebellion	_
among	_
early	_
Protestants	_
did	_
.	_

Another	_
worrisome	_
sign	_
is	_
that	_
local	_
Iraqi	_
Sunni	_
fundamentalists	_
opposed	_
to	_
the	_
US	_
presence	_
in	_
Iraq	_
have	_
begun	_
joining	_
Monotheism	_
and	_
Holy	_
War	_
,	_
and	_
wearing	_
its	_
distinctive	_
orange	_
and	_
black	_
insignia	_
.	_

These	_
have	_
been	_
sighted	_
among	_
Iraqi	_
crowds	_
on	_
Haifa	_
Street	_
in	_
Baghdad	_
and	_
in	_
Samarra	_
.	_

So	_
now	_
there	_
are	_
hundreds	_
of	_
al	_
-	_
Qaeda	_
members	_
in	_
Iraq	_
where	_
there	_
had	_
been	_
none	_
before	_
.	_

The	_
consolidation	_
of	_
smaller	_
local	_
radical	_
fundamentalist	_
groups	_
with	_
al	_
-	_
Qaeda	_
can	_
also	_
be	_
seen	_
in	_
the	_
case	_
of	_
the	_
Fizazi	_
group	_
in	_
Tangiers	_
that	_
morphed	_
into	_
the	_
Moroccan	_
Islamic	_
Combatant	_
Group	_
,	_
had	_
members	_
who	_
met	_
with	_
September	_
11	_
ringleader	_
Muhammad	_
Atta	_
,	_
and	_
ultimately	_
was	_
in	_
part	_
responsible	_
for	_
the	_
Madrid	_
train	_
bombings	_
.	_

The	_
September	_
11	_
Panel	_
will	_
issue	_
its	_
findings	_
on	_
Thursday	_
.	_

It	_
notes	_
10	_
points	_
at	_
which	_
the	_
US	_
made	_
key	_
mistakes	_
that	_
might	_
have	_
stopped	_
Bin	_
Laden	_
's	_
plot	_
.	_

Four	_
of	_
these	_
were	_
under	_
Clinton	_
and	_
6	_
under	_
Bush	_
.	_

Bush	_
came	_
out	_
today	_
and	_
said	_
that	_
if	_
he	_
had	_
known	_
what	_
was	_
coming	_
,	_
he	_
would	_
have	_
expended	_
every	_
effort	_
to	_
stop	_
it	_
,	_
and	_
that	_
so	_
would	_
have	_
Clinton	_
.	_

This	_
statement	_
is	_
,	_
despite	_
its	_
facade	_
of	_
fair	_
-	_
mindedness	_
,	_
so	_
many	_
weasel	_
words	_
.	_

Of	_
course	_
Bush	_
would	_
have	_
tried	_
to	_
stop	_
9/11	_
if	_
he	_
had	_
known	_
it	_
was	_
coming	_
.	_

The	_
question	_
is	_
,	_
"	_
Should	_
he	_
have	_
known	_
it	_
was	_
coming	_
?	_
"	_

The	_
answer	_
is	_
,	_
"	_
Yes	_
!	_
"	_

We	_
now	_
know	_
that	_
Bush	_
and	_
his	_
administration	_
came	_
into	_
office	_
obsessed	_
with	_
Iraq	_
.	_

Cheney	_
was	_
looking	_
at	_
maps	_
of	_
Iraq	_
oil	_
fields	_
and	_
muttering	_
about	_
opportunities	_
for	_
US	_
companies	_
there	_
,	_
already	_
in	_
January	_
or	_
February	_
of	_
2001	_
.	_

Wolfowitz	_
contradicted	_
counter-terrorism	_
czar	_
Richard	_
Clarke	_
when	_
the	_
latter	_
spoke	_
of	_
the	_
al	_
-	_
Qaeda	_
threat	_
,	_
insisting	_
that	_
the	_
preeminent	_
threat	_
of	_
terrorism	_
against	_
the	_
US	_
came	_
from	_
Iraq	_
,	_
and	_
indicating	_
he	_
accepted	_
Laurie	_
Mylroie	_
's	_
crackpot	_
conspiracy	_
theory	_
that	_
Saddam	_
was	_
behind	_
the	_
1993	_
World	_
Trade	_
Towers	_
bombing	_
.	_

If	_
you	_
believe	_
crackpot	_
theories	_
instead	_
of	_
focusing	_
on	_
the	_
reality	_
--	_
that	_
was	_
an	_
al	_
-	_
Qaeda	_
operation	_
mainly	_
carried	_
out	_
by	_
al	_
-	_
Gamaa	_
al	_
-	_
Islamiyyah	_
,	_
an	_
Egyptian	_
terrorist	_
component	_
allied	_
with	_
Bin	_
Laden	_
--	_
then	_
you	_
will	_
concentrate	_
on	_
the	_
wrong	_
threat	_
.	_

Even	_
after	_
the	_
attacks	_
on	_
September	_
11	_
,	_
Bush	_
was	_
obsessing	_
about	_
Iraq	_
.	_

Wolfowitz	_
lied	_
to	_
him	_
and	_
said	_
that	_
there	_
was	_
a	_
10	_
to	_
50	_
%	_
chance	_
that	_
Iraq	_
was	_
behind	_
them	_
.	_

(	_
On	_
what	_
evidence	_
?	_

The	_
hijackers	_
were	_
obviously	_
al	_
-	_
Qaeda	_
,	_
and	_
no	_
operational	_
links	_
between	_
al	_
-	_
Qaeda	_
and	_
Iraq	_
had	_
ever	_
been	_
found	_
)	_
.	_

Rumsfeld	_
initially	_
rejected	_
an	_
attack	_
on	_
al	_
-	_
Qaeda	_
bases	_
in	_
Afghanistan	_
,	_
saying	_
there	_
were	_
"	_
no	_
good	_
targets	_
"	_
in	_
Afghanistan	_
.	_

(	_
What	_
about	_
40	_

bases	_

had	_
trained	_
the	_
9/11	_
hijackers	_
and	_
other	_
terrorists	_
gunning	_
for	_
the	_
United	_
States	_
??	_
)	_

The	_
Pentagon	_
did	_
not	_
even	_
have	_
a	_
plan	_
for	_
dealing	_
with	_
Afghanistan	_
or	_
al	_
-	_
Qaeda	_
that	_
it	_
could	_
pull	_
off	_
the	_
shelf	_
,	_
according	_
to	_
Bob	_
Woodward	_
.	_

Bush	_
did	_
not	_
have	_
his	_
eye	_
on	_
the	_
ball	_
.	_

Neither	_
did	_
Cheney	_
,	_
Rumsfeld	_
,	_
or	_
Wolfowitz	_
.	_

They	_
were	_
playing	_
Captain	_

Imperial	_

of	_
people	_
in	_
the	_
CIA	_
and	_
counter-terrorism	_
divisions	_
elsewhere	_
in	_
the	_
US	_
government	_
knew	_
all	_
about	_
Bin	_
Laden	_
and	_
the	_
threat	_
he	_
posed	_
.	_

They	_
were	_
from	_
all	_
accounts	_
marginalized	_
and	_
not	_
listened	_
to	_

the	_
most	_
vocal	_
and	_
focused	_
of	_
the	_
al	_

experts	_

from	_
his	_
cabinet	_

Dick	_
could	_
never	_
thereafter	_
get	_
any	_
real	_
cooperation	_
from	_
the	_
cabinet	_
officers	_
,	_
who	_
outranked	_
him	_
,	_
and	_
he	_
could	_
not	_
convince	_
them	_
to	_
go	_
to	_
battle	_
stations	_
in	_
the	_
summer	_
of	_
2001	_
when	_
George	_
Tenet	_
's	_
hair	_
was	_
"	_
on	_
fire	_
"	_
about	_
the	_
excited	_
chatter	_
the	_
CIA	_
was	_
picking	_
up	_
from	_
radical	_
Islamist	_
terrorists	_
.	_

As	_
for	_
the	_
Clinton	_
administration	_
,	_
let	_
me	_
say	_
one	_
thing	_
in	_
its	_
defense	_
.	_

Clinton	_
had	_
worked	_
out	_
a	_
deal	_
with	_
Pakistani	_
Prime	_
Minister	_
Nawaz	_
Sharif	_
in	_
summer	_
of	_
1999	_
that	_
would	_
have	_
allowed	_
the	_
US	_
to	_
send	_
a	_
Special	_
Ops	_
team	_
in	_
after	_
Bin	_
Laden	_
in	_
Qandahar	_
,	_
based	_
from	_
Pakistan	_
.	_

I	_
presume	_
you	_
need	_
the	_
Pakistan	_
base	_
for	_
rescue	_
operations	_
in	_
case	_
anything	_
went	_
wrong	_
.	_

You	_
also	_
need	_
Pakistani	_
air	_
space	_
.	_

The	_
plan	_
was	_
all	_
set	_
and	_
could	_
have	_
succeeded	_
.	_

But	_
in	_
fall	_
of	_
1999	_
,	_
Gen.	_
Pervez	_
Musharraf	_
made	_
a	_
coup	_
against	_
Nawaz	_
Sharif	_
.	_

The	_
Pakistani	_
army	_
was	_
rife	_
with	_
elements	_
protective	_
of	_
the	_
Taliban	_
,	_
and	_
the	_
new	_
military	_
government	_
reneged	_
on	_
the	_
deal	_
.	_

Musharraf	_
told	_
Clinton	_
he	_
could	_
n't	_
use	_
Pakistani	_
soil	_
or	_
air	_
space	_
to	_
send	_
the	_
team	_
in	_
against	_
Bin	_
Laden	_
.	_

Look	_
at	_
a	_
map	_
and	_
you	_
try	_
to	_
figure	_
out	_
how	_
,	_
in	_
fall	_
of	_
1999	_
,	_
you	_
could	_
possibly	_
pull	_
off	_
such	_
an	_
operation	_
without	_
Pakistani	_
facilities	_
.	_

Of	_
course	_
,	_
you	_
could	_
just	_
go	_
in	_
by	_
main	_
force	_
.	_

But	_
for	_
those	_
of	_
you	_
tempted	_
in	_
that	_
direction	_
,	_
please	_
look	_
up	_
Carter	_
's	_
Tabas	_
operation	_
.	_

It	_
should	_
be	_
easily	_
googled	_
.	_

Clinton	_
tried	_
,	_
and	_
tried	_
hard	_

one	_

John	_
,	_

Hello	_
from	_
South	_
America	_
.	_

I	_
just	_
got	_
your	_
email	_
and	_
I	_
certainly	_
concur	_
with	_
Jeff	_
making	_
the	_
call	_
.	_

He	_
has	_
maintained	_
a	_
good	_
relationship	_
with	_
Mulva	_
.	_

This	_
was	_
a	_
risk	_
that	_
we	_
had	_
but	_
we	_
did	_
have	_
assurances	_
from	_
Phillips	_
regarding	_
performance	_
.	_

I	_
do	_
n't	_
know	_
how	_
much	_
it	_
will	_
help	_
however	_
.	_

Richard	_
Harper	_
and	_
Mary	_
Nell	_
Browning	_
may	_
have	_
some	_
ideas	_
here	_
but	_
I	_
am	_
sure	_
you	_
've	_
already	_
gone	_
through	_
it	_
with	_
them	_
.	_

I	_
am	_
amazed	_
how	_
the	_
details	_
get	_
fuzzy	_
on	_
an	_
old	_
project	_
.	_

When	_
you	_
discussed	_
it	_
,	_
i	_
was	_
trying	_
to	_
think	_
back	_
to	_
our	_
remedies	_
and	_
discussions	_
but	_
the	_
3	_
years	_
have	_
made	_
it	_
difficult	_
.	_

I	_
do	_
n't	_
know	_
if	_
there	_
is	_
anything	_
I	_
can	_
do	_
but	_
I	_
'm	_
always	_
willing	_
to	_
help	_
.	_

Good	_
luck	_
,	_

Mike	_

I	_

this	_
report	_

Hi	_
David	_
:	_

Thought	_
that	_
you	_
might	_
be	_
interested	_
.	_

Best	_
,	_

Jeff	_

Well	_
,	_
he	_
launched	_
today	_
.	_

Have	_
you	_
seen	_
the	_
materials	_
from	_
the	_
press	_
conference	_
that	_
he	_
launched	_
today	_
?	_

I	_
think	_
this	_
is	_
actually	_
a	_
good	_
thing	_
--	_
makes	_
our	_
proposal	_
look	_
like	_
a	_
much	_
more	_
preferable	_
alternative	_
by	_
comparison	_
,	_
makes	_
our	_
support	_
in	_
the	_
process	_
more	_
important	_
,	_
and	_
sets	_
Harvey	_
up	_
as	_
the	_
Ralph	_
Nader	_
equivalent	_
in	_
the	_
election	_
to	_
fix	_
California	_
's	_
broken	_
system	_
---	_

potential	_
spoiler	_
.	_

Hi	_
.	_

Well	_
,	_
would	_
n't	_
you	_
know	_
it	_
.	_

I	_
'm	_
not	_
driving	_
tonite	_
,	_
but	_
I	_
bet	_
that	_
we	_
could	_
hitch	_
a	_
ride	_
back	_
with	_
Anil	_
.	_

I	_
'm	_
not	_
sure	_
,	_
but	_
I	_
think	_
that	_
he	_
's	_
got	_
class	_
tonite	_
,	_
too	_
.	_

I	_
'll	_
search	_
him	_
out	_
before	_
class	_
or	_
after	_
that	_
break	_
and	_
see	_
if	_
I	_
can	_
set	_
it	_
up	_
.	_

daily	_
dose	_
on	_
enron	_
-	_

we	_
are	_
finished	_
.	_

i	_
need	_
to	_
now	_
get	_
a	_
job	_
at	_
house	_
of	_
pies	_
b/c	_
that	_
is	_
the	_
only	_
way	_
to	_
pay	_
the	_
bills	_
.	_

the	_
economy	_
is	_
down	_
and	_
when	_
enron	_
collapses	_
,	_
the	_
energy	_
industry	_
is	_
going	_
to	_
be	_
in	_
a	_
world	_
of	_
hurt	_
.	_

not	_
to	_
mention	_
the	_
market	_
is	_
going	_
to	_
be	_
flooded	_
with	_
enron	_
folks	_
.	_

ca	_
n't	_
go	_
to	_
any	_
more	_
lsu	_
games	_
unless	_
i	_
get	_
a	_
free	_
ticket	_
.	_

Since	_
work	_
has	_
gone	_
to	_
hell	_
,	_
I	_
am	_
hoping	_
to	_
find	_
some	_
excitement	_
in	_
the	_
possibility	_
that	_
LSU	_
may	_
play	_
in	_
the	_
Cotton	_
Bowl	_
(	_
if	_
Rohan	_
"	_
Alabama	_
"	_
Davey	_
shows	_
up	_
for	_
the	_
next	_
3	_
games	_
.	_
)	_

However	_
,	_
do	_
not	_
purchase	_
tickets	_
until	_
it	_
is	_
a	_
done	_
deal	_
-	_
a	_
lesson	_
I	_
learned	_
following	_
the	_
Ark	_

here	_

i	_
am	_
sure	_
i	_
could	_
have	_
persuaded	_
you	_
to	_
give	_
me	_
some	_
action	_
.	_

why	_
is	_

blowing	_
up	_

i	_
did	_
n't	_

was	_
just	_
going	_

was	_

Vince	_

We	_
are	_
still	_
trying	_
to	_
work	_
the	_
PSE	_
swap	_
transaction	_
,	_
now	_
that	_
the	_
forex	_
desk	_
has	_
been	_
able	_
to	_
find	_
a	_
fix	_
for	_
CPI	_
in	_
the	_
market	_
.	_

Further	_
to	_
my	_
voicemail	_
,	_
our	_
colleagues	_
in	_
credit	_
are	_
calculating	_
the	_
reserve	_
on	_
the	_
PSE	_
swap	_
.	_

They	_
are	_
currently	_
using	_
9.5	_
%	_
fixed	_
based	_
on	_
the	_
1	_
year	_
implied	_
volatility	_
.	_

Volatility	_
of	_
USD	_
/	_
DM	_
has	_
been	_
in	_
the	_
range	_
of	_
between	_
7	_
%	_
and	_
11	_
%	_
.	_

Can	_
one	_
of	_
your	_
research	_
staff	_
justify	_
a	_
suitable	_
20	_
year	_
volalatility	_
number	_
for	_
USD	_
/	_
Euro	_
.	_

Ideally	_
,	_
we	_
would	_
like	_
a	_
fast	_
turnaround	_
.	_

In	_
addition	_
,	_
is	_
there	_
someone	_
who	_
could	_
consider	_
the	_
correlation	_
between	_
US	_
CPI	_
and	_
the	_
$	_
/	_
euro	_
exchange	_
rate	_
.	_

The	_
credit	_
guys	_
are	_
currently	_
assuming	_
that	_
there	_
is	_
no	_
correlation	_
and	_
may	_
consequently	_
be	_
double	_
dipping	_
the	_
credit	_
reserve	_
on	_
this	_
basis	_
too	_
.	_

Grateful	_
for	_
any	_
help	_
or	_
suggestions	_
you	_
could	_
provide	_
.	_

Vincent	_

I	_
met	_
you	_
at	_
the	_
Risk	_

Houston	_

I	_
enjoyed	_
your	_

very	_
much	_

I	_
was	_
wondering	_
if	_
you	_
could	_
give	_

Hi	_

I	_
understand	_
you	_
may	_
not	_
have	_
credit	_
approval	_

Daren	_
,	_

I	_
was	_
wondering	_
if	_
it	_
would	_
be	_
OK	_
for	_
me	_
to	_
sit	_
in	_
with	_
you	_
one	_
day	_
to	_
get	_
a	_
general	_
feel	_
of	_
your	_
end	_
of	_
the	_
process	_
.	_

Pat	_
had	_
told	_
me	_
before	_
he	_
left	_
that	_
it	_
would	_
help	_
me	_
better	_
grasp	_
the	_
process	_
as	_
a	_
whole	_
.	_

I	_
understand	_
the	_
imminent	_
cold	_
weather	_
is	_
making	_
things	_
crazy	_
,	_
so	_
now	_
may	_
not	_
be	_
the	_
best	_
time	_
to	_
be	_
in	_
your	_
way	_
.	_

But	_
let	_
me	_
know	_
if	_
I	_
can	_
spend	_
a	_
day	_
,	_
morning	_
,	_
or	_
even	_
just	_
an	_
afternoon	_
down	_
there	_
with	_
you	_
whenever	_
it	_
is	_
a	_
good	_
time	_
.	_

I	_
think	_
it	_
will	_
help	_
me	_
very	_
much	_
in	_
my	_
role	_
.	_

Thanks	_

The	_
Dow	_
topped	_
out	_
in	_
February	_
of	_
1966	_
at	_
995	_
.	_

By	_
September	_
of	_
that	_
year	_
the	_
Dow	_
had	_
tumbled	_
to	_
744	_
.	_

The	_
Dow	_
then	_
rallied	_
to	_
a	_
high	_
of	_
943	_
in	_
September	_
of	_
'67	_
.	_

By	_
March	_
of	_
'68	_
the	_
Dow	_
had	_
fallen	_
to	_
825	_
,	_
only	_
to	_
climb	_
to	_
a	_
highly	_
speculative	_
peak	_
of	_
985	_
in	_
December	_
of	_
'68	_
.	_

The	_
Dow	_
then	_
sank	_
to	_
631	_
in	_
December	_
of	_
'70	_
.	_

By	_
April	_
of	_
'71	_
the	_
Dow	_
had	_
climbed	_
back	_
to	_
950	_
,	_
only	_
to	_
fall	_
to	_
869	_
in	_
February	_
of	_
'72	_
.	_

A	_
big	_
rally	_
then	_
took	_
the	_
Dow	_
(	_
unconfirmed	_
)	_
to	_
a	_
record	_
high	_
of	_
1051	_
in	_
January	_
of	_
'73	_
,	_
turning	_
everyone	_
bullish	_
.	_

But	_
by	_
December	_
of	_
'73	_
the	_
Dow	_
had	_
collapsed	_
to	_
788	_
.	_

Think	_
that	_
was	_
bad	_
-	_
by	_
December	_
of	_
'74	_
the	_
Dow	_
had	_
sunk	_
to	_
a	_
bear	_
market	_
low	_
of	_
577	_
.	_

At	_
that	_
time	_
,	_
the	_
gurus	_
and	_
geniuses	_
of	_
Wall	_
Street	_
were	_
predicting	_
a	_
250	_
Dow	_
and	_
many	_
were	_
talking	_
openly	_
about	_
the	_
end	_
of	_
capitalism	_
.	_

Of	_
course	_
,	_
that	_
was	_
the	_
bottom	_

And	_
that	_
's	_
the	_
way	_
the	_
greatest	_
bear	_
market	_
since	_
the	_
Depression	_
worked	_
its	_
way	_
down	_
.	_

By	_
late	_
1974	_
investors	_
were	_
dizzy	_
,	_
they	_
were	_
desperate	_
,	_
they	_
were	_
wrung	_
-	_
out	_
,	_
they	_

The	_
results	_
of	_
the	_
February	_
26th	_
PVT	_
test	_
conducted	_
on	_
Nville	_
have	_
been	_
discussed	_
with	_
each	_
of	_
you	_
over	_
the	_
last	_
three	_
months	_
.	_

As	_
we	_
have	_
discussed	_
....	_
effective	_
Sep	_
13th	_
,	_
Anita	_
will	_
make	_
the	_
adjustments	_
to	_
Enron	_
's	_
inventory	_
and	_
pad	_
gas	_
to	_
reflect	_
the	_
February	_
26th	_
results	_
.	_

I	_
talked	_
with	_
Gary	_
Wilson	_
,	_
and	_
he	_
confirmed	_
that	_
the	_
revised	_
values	_
are	_
correct	_
.	_

Attached	_
is	_
a	_
spreadsheet	_
that	_
contains	_
the	_
values	_
.	_

The	_
correction	_
to	_
the	_
working	_
gas	_
includes	_
TWO	_
corrections	_
.	_

The	_
results	_
of	_
the	_
February	_
26th	_
test	_
reduces	_
the	_
working	_
gas	_
by	_
398,487	_
MMBTU	_
.	_

In	_
addition	_
,	_
there	_
is	_
a	_
reduction	_
of	_
22,101	_
MMBTU	_
which	_
is	_
the	_
difference	_
between	_
the	_
SCADA	_
values	_
(	_
Best	_
Available	_
)	_
that	_
Anita	_
showed	_
on	_
the	_
February	_
29th	_
Storage	_
Sheet	_
and	_
the	_
"	_
official	_
"	_
February	_
29th	_
values	_
that	_
Gary	_
Wilson	_
received	_
from	_
MIPS	_
.	_

To	_
summarize	_
:	_
Enron	_
's	_
pad	_
gas	_
will	_
now	_
be	_
3,993,310	_
MMBTU	_
,	_
instead	_
of	_
4,223,000	_
MMBTU	_
.	_

Enron	_
's	_
working	_
gas	_
will	_
be	_
reduced	_
by	_
420,588	_
MMBTU	_
.	_

Call	_
me	_
if	_
there	_
are	_
any	_
questions	_
.	_

drunk	_
but	_
z	_
was	_
n't	_
having	_
any	_
of	_
that	_
conversation	_
.	_

she	_
told	_
me	_
that	_
after	_
friday	_
and	_
saturday	_
she	_
felt	_
i	_
was	_
slowly	_
regressing	_

her	_
it	_
's	_
normal	_
to	_
drink	_
all	_
day	_
at	_
a	_
bar	_
,	_
then	_
go	_
to	_
dinner	_
where	_
you	_
do	_
n't	_
know	_
half	_
the	_
people	_
there	_
and	_
proceed	_
to	_
get	_
extremely	_
fucked	_
up	_

Attached	_
are	_
clean	_
and	_
blacklined	_
drafts	_
of	_
the	_
Enron	_
guaranties	_
to	_
be	_
made	_
in	_
support	_
of	_
EPMI	_
's	_
obligations	_
under	_
the	_
Indian	_
Mesa	_
II	_
Renewable	_
Energy	_
Purchase	_
Agreement	_
(	_
"	_
PPA	_
"	_
)	_
and	_
Green	_
Premium	_
Sharing	_
Agreement	_
(	_
"	_
GSPA	_
"	_
)	_
.?	_

The	_
guaranty	_
for	_
the	_
PPA	_
is	_
blacklined	_
against	_
the	_
Enron	_
EPC	_
Contract	_
guaranty	_
in	_
favor	_
of	_
the	_
banks	_
which	_
was	_
granted	_
in	_
connection	_
with	_
our	_
Cabazon	_
Wind	_
Power	_
Project	_
(	_
the	_
project	_
most	_
recently	_
financed	_
by	_
EWC	_
)	_
and	_
the	_
GPSA	_
guaranty	_
is	_
blacklined	_
against	_
the	_
PPA	_
guaranty	_
.	_

As	_
we	_
discussed	_
last	_
week	_
,	_
since	_
the	_
Enron	_
guaranties	_
will	_
need	_
to	_
be	_
in	_
a	_
form	_
that	_
will	_
acceptable	_
to	_
our	_
project	_
lenders	_
and	_
equity	_
participants	_
,	_
we	_
thought	_
that	_
we	_
should	_
start	_
with	_
a	_
form	_
that	_
was	_
used	_
in	_
our	_
last	_
financing	_
and	_
that	_
was	_
negotiated	_
by	_
Enron	_
and	_
the	_
banks	_
.	_

We	_
plan	_
to	_
use	_
the	_
same	_
basic	_
form	_
for	_
the	_
Enron	_
guaranty	_
that	_
will	_
be	_
made	_
in	_
favor	_
of	_
EPMI	_
with	_
respect	_
to	_
the	_
seller	_
's	_
obligations	_
under	_
the	_
PPA	_
.	_

We	_
will	_
forward	_
the	_
draft	_
of	_
that	_
guaranty	_
to	_
you	_
later	_
today	_
.	_

Please	_
feel	_
free	_
to	_
give	_
me	_
a	_
call	_
if	_
you	_
have	_
any	_
questions	_
concerning	_
the	_
attached	_
guaranties	_

Your	_
suggestion	_
to	_
introduce	_
the	_
concept	_
discussed	_
with	_
one	_
of	_
the	_
Lays	_
is	_
welcomed	_
.	_

I	_
hope	_
that	_
this	_
would	_
mean	_
that	_
you	_
would	_
remain	_
involved	_
at	_
some	_
level	_
.	_

The	_
design	_
of	_
the	_
model	_
and	_
its	_
potential	_
economics	_
could	_
be	_
key	_
to	_
how	_
worthy	_
the	_
effort	_
might	_
be	_
.	_

Enron	_
could	_
be	_
an	_
ideal	_
environment	_
from	_
which	_
to	_
the	_
concept	_
enhancement	_
through	_
to	_
commercialization	_
could	_
be	_
successfully	_
accomplished	_
.	_

Please	_
confidentially	_
share	_
matters	_
as	_
you	_
think	_
best	_
and	_
advise	_
me	_
of	_
the	_
interest	_
generated	_
.	_

I	_
am	_
ready	_
to	_
meet	_
there	_
at	_
your	_
building	_
or	_
elsewhere	_
that	_
is	_
appropriate	_

No	_
problem	_

Please	_
,	_
ask	_
Stinson	_
as	_
well	_
.	_

Vince	_

I	_
thought	_
that	_
since	_
Chonawee	_
has	_
an	_
optimization	_
background	_
,	_
he	_
would	_
be	_
good	_
to	_
have	_
him	_
go	_
to	_
dinner	_
with	_
Dr.	_
Lasdon	_
on	_

Would	_
this	_
be	_
fine	_

We	_
are	_
still	_
trying	_

have	_
the	_

books	_
that	_
you	_
provided	_

Hello	_
there	_

Action	_
Network	_
is	_
a	_
BBC	_
website	_
for	_
people	_
who	_
are	_
taking	_
action	_
on	_
issues	_
that	_
concern	_
them	_
.	_

I	_
'm	_
getting	_
in	_
touch	_
because	_
I	_
think	_
it	_
could	_
be	_
useful	_
to	_
people	_
campaigning	_
about	_
hospital	_
closures	_
.	_

We	_
've	_
got	_
a	_
page	_
dedicated	_
to	_
issues	_
around	_
hospitals	_
(	_
http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/actionnetwork/C55153	_
)	_
and	_
a	_
group	_
called	_
NHS	_
SOS	_
have	_
already	_
put	_
up	_
a	_
campaign	_
about	_
ward	_
closures	_
in	_
Cumbria	_
.	_

I	_
'm	_
hoping	_
to	_
build	_
this	_
up	_
to	_
be	_
a	_
hub	_
for	_
all	_
the	_
campaigners	_
-	_
a	_
place	_
where	_
people	_
can	_
exchange	_
ideas	_
and	_
advice	_
.	_

It	_
would	_
be	_
great	_
if	_
the	_
person	_
from	_
CHANT	_
who	_
started	_
this	_
page	_
would	_
put	_
up	_
a	_
short	_
description	_
of	_
the	_
campaign	_
and	_
a	_
list	_
to	_
this	_
group	_
page	_
on	_
the	_
Action	_
Network	_
site	_
.	_

Action	_
Network	_
is	_
also	_
a	_
good	_
place	_
to	_
post	_
details	_
of	_
events	_
,	_
or	_
try	_
to	_
rally	_
together	_
a	_
group	_
if	_
you	_
want	_
to	_
take	_
action	_
in	_
your	_
area	_
.	_

You	_
can	_
attach	_
anything	_
you	_
write	_
to	_
pages	_
for	_
your	_
local	_
area	_
,	_
as	_
well	_
as	_
to	_
the	_
'	_
issue	_
'	_
pages	_
.	_

I	_
'm	_
more	_
than	_
happy	_
to	_
help	_
people	_
with	_
the	_
site	_
or	_
answer	_
any	_
questions	_
about	_
Action	_
Network	_
-	_
just	_
drop	_
me	_
a	_

Otherwise	_

hope	_
to	_
see	_
you	_
there	_

,	_
"	_
Winston	_
says	_
,	_
"	_
That	_

be	_
an	_

"	_

A	_
girl	_
raises	_
her	_

"	_
If	_
a	_

carrying	_
fifty	_

"	_
I	_

explains	_

,	_
"	_
that	_

what	_

The	_

none	_

Finally	_
,	_
a	_
boy	_
in	_
the	_

raises	_
his	_

In	_
a	_

Well	_

the	_

budget	_
may	_
be	_
kinda	_
tight	_

a	_
project	_

this	_

This	_
group	_
does	_
sound	_
pretty	_
interesting	_
though	_

The	_
Lunar	_
Transporatation	_

both	_
are	_
also	_
involved	_
with	_
another	_

U.S.	_

will	_
launch	_
to	_
the	_
moon	_
on	_
sleek	_
,	_
single	_
,	_
shuttle	_

the	_
first	_

upper	_

rocket	_
this	_
country	_
has	_
developed	_
in	_
more	_

a	_
decade	_
,	_
NASA	_
and	_
the	_
Pentagon	_
have	_
told	_
the	_

Lunar	_
landers	_
and	_
other	_
gear	_
needed	_
for	_
extended	_

will	_

the	_
most	_

is	_
transitioning	_
away	_
from	_
the	_
shuttle	_
model	_
,	_
as	_
in	_
the	_
past	_
they	_
have	_
proven	_
to	_
be	_
quite	_
dangerous	_
as	_
Columbia	_
has	_
recently	_
proved	_
.	_

Although	_
these	_
new	_
rockets	_
are	_
probably	_
more	_
expensive	_
,	_
they	_
will	_
be	_
able	_
to	_
go	_
at	_
a	_
much	_
greater	_
range	_
than	_
it's	_
shuttle	_
cousins	_
,	_
as	_
they	_
can	_
not	_
only	_
break	_
free	_
from	_
the	_
atmosphere	_
but	_
reach	_
the	_
moon	_
as	_
well	_

with	_
industry	_
forecasters	_
predicting	_
a	_
launch	_
as	_
early	_
as	_
2014	_

The	_
new	_
rocket	_
design	_
will	_
differ	_
slightly	_
from	_
it's	_
predecessors	_

in	_
the	_
fact	_
that	_
the	_

launch	_

The	_

about	_

they	_

VERY	_
CONCERNED	_

plz	_
bring	_
your	_
dog	_
to	_
the	_
vet	_
ASAP	_
!!!	_

esp	_
if	_
not	_
eating	_
-	_
if	_
it	_
had	_
only	_
happened	_
once	_
and	_
could	_
get	_
him	_
to	_
eat	_
right	_
away	_
-	_
it	_
could	_
have	_
been	_
you	_
missed	_
his	_
meal	_
time	_
and	_
he	_
needed	_
to	_
eat	_
-	_
since	_
it	_
sounds	_
like	_
it	_
has	_
happened	_
several	_
times	_
over	_
two	_
days	_
-	_
then	_
he	_
may	_
have	_
gotten	_
int	_
to	_
something	_
that	_
needs	_
to	_
be	_
attended	_
to	_
RIGHT	_
AWAY	_

or	_
has	_

too	_
needs	_
to	_
be	_

...	_

why	_
are	_
there	_
two	_
statues	_
of	_
David	_
?	_

i	_
doing	_
a	_
research	_
paper	_
on	_
donatello	_
and	_
i	_
notice	_
that	_
there	_
are	_
two	_
statues	_
of	_
David	_
,	_
a	_
bronze	_
one	_
and	_
marble	_
one	_
.	_

Michelangelo	_
made	_
the	_
marble	_
one	_
but	_
why	_
did	_
he	_
do	_
another	_
if	_
Donatello	_
had	_
already	_
made	_
one	_
?	_

so	_
i	_
m	_
a	_
little	_
confused	_
,	_
why	_
is	_
there	_
two	_
statues	_
of	_
David	_
?	_

different	_
generations	_
,	_
the	_
donatello	_
is	_
of	_
a	_
boy	_
david	_
as	_
a	_
young	_
sheep	_
Herder	_
,	_
the	_
Michelangelo	_
is	_
the	_
grown	_
up	_
man	_
david	_
as	_
slayer	_
and	_
king	_

Because	_
he	_
liked	_
making	_
statues	_
of	_
David	_
!	_
:D	_

Obviously	_
,	_
he	_
should	_
have	_
been	_
arrested	_
and	_
jailed	_
-	_
imagine	_
making	_
a	_
statue	_
or	_
painting	_
on	_
the	_
same	_
subject	_
as	_
another	_
artist	_
-	_
clearly	_
insulting	_
and	_
disrespecting	_
-	_
wasted	_
time	_
that	_
could	_
have	_
been	_
used	_
making	_
a	_
statue	_
with	_
clothes	_
on	_

What	_
's	_
the	_
best	_
time	_
to	_
start	_
a	_
trip	_
around	_
the	_
world	_
?	_

Well	_
,	_
I	_
'm	_
about	_
to	_
graduate	_
in	_
less	_
then	_
a	_
year	_
,	_
and	_
I	_
'm	_
planning	_
to	_
study	_
medical	_
school	_
.	_

But	_
since	_
in	_
my	_
country	_
it	_
lasts	_
for	_
minimum	_
6	_
years	_
,	_
and	_
I	_
want	_
to	_
go	_
aground	_
the	_
world	_
,	_
what	_
do	_
you	_
think	_
,	_
should	_
I	_
do	_
it	_
before	_
or	_
after	_
medical	_
school	_
?	_

If	_
you	_
can	_
afford	_
to	_
go	_
before	_
,	_
then	_
by	_
all	_
means	_
,	_
GO	_
.	_

If	_
you	_
have	_
to	_
wait	_
,	_
due	_
to	_
financial	_
reasons	_
,	_
then	_
wait	_
.	_

I	_
would	_
much	_
rather	_
put	_
it	_
off	_
until	_
I	_
can	_
afford	_
to	_
have	_
the	_
vacation	_
of	_
a	_
lifetime	_
as	_
I	_
'm	_
sure	_
this	_
trip	_
is	_
intended	_
to	_
be	_
.	_

Airfare	_
alone	_
will	_
be	_
incredibly	_
expensive	_
so	_
make	_
sure	_
you	_
have	_
the	_
money	_
and	_
of	_
course	_
free	_
time	_
to	_
take	_
your	_
time	_
and	_
have	_
a	_

the	_

only	_
begins	_

did	_
anyone	_
have	_
this	_

is	_

Sounds	_

Your	_

is	_
n't	_
acting	_
normally	_
,	_
you	_
got	_
warranty	_
,	_
let	_
Canon	_
deal	_
with	_
it	_

I	_
would	_
agree	_

I	_
shoot	_
a	_

have	_
n't	_
had	_
such	_
an	_
issue	_
.	_

I	_
also	_
agree	_
it	_
's	_
under	_
warranty	_
so	_
get	_
in	_
touch	_
with	_
Canon	_
.	_

It	_
sounds	_
like	_
a	_
firmware	_
issue	_
and	_
the	_
camera	_
requires	_
a	_
re-boot	_
just	_
like	_
what	_
happens	_
in	_
a	_
computer	_
-	_
needs	_
a	_
re-start	_
from	_
time	_
to	_
time	_
but	_
it	_
should	_
n't	_
be	_
happening	_
in	_

I	_
decided	_
to	_
get	_
a	_
150	_
gal	_
aquarium	_
,	_
what	_
can	_
I	_
fill	_
it	_
with	_
?	_

I	_
was	_
thinking	_
cichlids	_
?	_

Possibly	_
a	_
freshwater	_
tank	_
with	_
a	_
ton	_
of	_
different	_
species	_
in	_
there	_
.	_

I	_
've	_
never	_
kept	_
cichlids	_
though	_
.	_

I	_
know	_
saltwater	_
is	_
a	_
possibility	_
,	_
can	_
you	_
give	_
me	_
a	_
possible	_
stocking	_
option	_
for	_
that	_
too	_
?	_

I	_
'll	_
choose	_
the	_
one	_
that	_
sounds	_
the	_
best	_
after	_
looking	_
into	_
all	_
the	_
fish	_
:)	_

Here	_
is	_
the	_
stocking	_
for	_
my	_
150	_
gallon	_
tank	_
i	_
upgraded	_
it	_
to	_
200	_
at	_
the	_
weekend	_
because	_
of	_
the	_
clownloach	_
A	_

it	_
would	_
make	_
a	_
nice	_
150	_

gave	_
Dr.	_
Rohatgi	_
2	_

her	_

is	_
easy	_
to	_
use	_
and	_
it	_
keeps	_
the	_
cold	_
out	_
during	_
the	_
winter	_
.	_

The	_
sales	_
staff	_
and	_
the	_
installation	_
staff	_
were	_
all	_
easy	_
to	_
get	_
along	_
with	_

I	_
highly	_
recommend	_

umm	_
...	_

okay	_
,	_
I	_
do	_
nt	_
have	_
a	_
review	_
,	_
but	_
why	_
in	_
the	_
hell	_
would	_
you	_
name	_
your	_
business	_
something	_
that	_
has	_
the	_
initials	_
KKK	_
....	_
is	_
there	_
something	_
behind	_
the	_
scenes	_
at	_
this	_
place	_
?	_

Like	_
I	_
'm	_
legitimately	_
concerned	_
at	_
this	_
point	_
...	_
lol	_

Fresh	_
and	_
Excellent	_
Quality	_

We	_
order	_
take	_
out	_
from	_
here	_
all	_
the	_
time	_
and	_
we	_
are	_
never	_
disappointed	_
.	_

The	_
food	_
is	_
always	_
fresh	_
and	_
delicious	_
.	_

It	_
can	_
be	_
a	_
little	_
on	_
the	_
spicy	_
side	_
but	_
just	_
ask	_
them	_
exactly	_
what	_
you	_
want	_
and	_
they	_
are	_
very	_
helpful	_
.	_

I	_
really	_
want	_
to	_
like	_
this	_
place	_
since	_
I	_
work	_
right	_
around	_
the	_
corner	_
.	_

Unfortunately	_
,	_
I	_
've	_
given	_
it	_
a	_
couple	_
of	_
tries	_
at	_
different	_
times	_
and	_
decided	_
to	_
stop	_
going	_
.	_

The	_
employees	_
do	_
n't	_
really	_
seem	_
to	_
enjoy	_
what	_
they	_
are	_
doing	_
and	_
it	_
shows	_
.	_

Class	_
act	_
.	_

It	_
was	_
late	_
in	_
the	_
day	_
and	_
I	_
was	_
worried	_
I	_
would	_
get	_
charged	_
an	_
arm	_
and	_
a	_
leg	_
and	_
have	_
to	_
wait	_
forever	_
.	_

They	_
picked	_
my	_
car	_
up	_
in	_
Yarmouth	_
and	_
towed	_
to	_
Bath	_
for	_
a	_
great	_
price	_
.	_

Would	_
do	_
business	_
with	_
them	_
again	_
.	_

Great	_

walked	_
me	_
through	_
all	_
the	_
steps	_
involved	_
in	_
the	_
the	_

so	_
that	_
there	_
were	_
no	_

I	_

service	_

I	_
used	_

my	_

there	_
all	_
the	_
time	_

changes	_
hands	_
too	_
frequently	_
,	_
the	_
service	_
has	_
been	_
slow	_

and	_
they	_
often	_
try	_
to	_
"	_
add	_
on	_
"	_
extra	_

which	_
sometimes	_
is	_

My	_
favorite	_
place	_

My	_
daughter	_
and	_
I	_
stayed	_
here	_
again	_
from	_
the	_
7th	_
to	_
the	_
14th	_
of	_
December	_
.	_

yet	_
again	_
it	_
was	_
a	_
great	_
stay	_
from	_
begiinning	_
to	_
end	_
.	_

Okay	_
our	_
room	_
was	_
at	_
times	_
noisy	_
but	_
we	_
were	_
in	_
a	_
mega	_
busy	_
city	_
at	_
an	_
extremely	_
busy	_
time	_

Expect	_
either	_
undercooked	_

mushy	_
food	_
and	_
lackluster	_
service	_
.	_

The	_
investors	_
put	_
big	_
bucks	_
into	_

building	_
but	_
are	_
clueless	_
about	_
what	_
makes	_
a	_
good	_
dining	_

experience	_

the	_

know	_

I	_
have	_
been	_
going	_
there	_

love	_

service	_

I	_
have	_
eaten	_
here	_
several	_
times	_
and	_
every	_
time	_
the	_
service	_
is	_
slower	_
than	_
slow	_
.	_

One	_
time	_
we	_
even	_
left	_
after	_
sitting	_
at	_
the	_
table	_
for	_
20	_
minutes	_
and	_
not	_
being	_
greeted	_
with	_
